## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Single quote the software name 'Julia' in the Title.

* Remove "The 'JuliaCall' package" in the Description in order to reduce redundancy.

* Use CRAN template for MIT license and change the LICENSE file.

## Test environments
* local OS X 10.12, R 3.4.0
* OS X 10.12 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1 and R-devel
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* windows (on appveyor), R 3.4.1 and R-devel with Rtools34
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
